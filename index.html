		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>
			<!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
			You may introduce some background information about your project, including client's name, their business, and the problem to be solved.
			<br> 
		</p>

		<h3>Scope</h3>
		<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->

			The goal of our project is to develop a solution for a visual approach that will capture signal change information at traffic intersections without interferring with the traffic controller. <br> 
			In addition to capturing this data, it will also be demonstrated on a webapp in real time.		
		</p>

		<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
		<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
			Create a software that camera can capture traffic signal changes through video feed without utilizing the traffic controller.<br>
			Make the data available on a mobile app to be used as a standalone internal interface.<br>
			There soon will be able to stand alone software has the ability to jumpstart infrastructure thanks to 350000 signalized traffic intersection in the US.<br> 
		</p>
