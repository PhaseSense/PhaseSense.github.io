		<h3>Background</h3>

			<!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
			You may introduce some background information about your project, including client's name, their business, and the problem to be solved.

		<h3>Scope</h3>
		<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->

			The goal of our project is to develop a solution for a visual approach that will capture signal change information at traffic intersections without interferring with the traffic controller. <br> 
			In addition to capturing this data, it will also be demonstrated on a webapp in real time.		
		</p>

		<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
		<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
			Create a software that camera can capture traffic signal changes through video feed without utilizing the traffic controller.<br>
			Make the data available on a mobile app to be used as a standalone internal interface.<br>
			There soon will be able to stand alone software has the ability to jumpstart infrastructure thanks to 350000 signalized traffic intersection in the US.<br>

			<h3>Highlights</h3>
			<h4>Importance</h4>
			<p>
				This project is important because it addresses a large hurdle when it comes to the development of smart city upgrades. 
				Real time data of traffic lights is a crucial part of being able to make optimizations to reduce traffic wait time and congestion in cities. 
				There are over 330,000 traffic intersections in the US alone, and a vast majority of them are not able to transmit their current status at all.
				Our project aims to be a solution to this problem by being an infrastructure-independent way to capture and transmit traffic signal changes in real time rather than going through the far more expensive and time consuming process of replacing an intersection entirely.	
			</p>
			<p>
				This project is unique because there are no public working devices or models that can capture, encode, and transmit traffic signal data in real time aside from ones that are built directly into the traffic intersections.
				Even if our project does not become the final product, it will act as a proof of concept that it is possible to upgrade existing infrastructure to capture and transmit traffic signal changes in real time rather than replacing it.
